# Zoom Stock Prediction
## Zoom Stock Prediction using Machine Learning in Python
This Zoom Stock Prediction program is a Machine Learning program to predict Zoom's stock closing price based on the opening price in the last three days. In making the prediction, this program utilizes Long Short Term Memory or LSTM. The development of this program aims to determine whether the closing price of shares can be predicted with the opening price of the previous three days using Machine Learning. In addition to predicting the closing price, in this program we can also do various other things. We can examine the Zoom stock dataset used in this program and also perform some operations on the dataset such as viewing the features' correlation in the dataset and the histogram for each feature. In addition, we can also perform a train test split in the program by specifying the test size and random state to generate evaluations based on several metrics.
